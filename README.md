# Flex Scheduler

## Minimalist work day scheduling tool
This tool is built with bootstrap, html, css, and javascript. 
Colors change as the day progresses. Save your data and revisit the page any time.

## Features
This tool can save you data in localStorage so that it always remembers your schedule. A simple layout and bright colors always let you know what time of day it is.

## How it works
The javascript references Moment.js to track time and programmatically adjust the colors of the hour blocks through DOM manipulation. Input from the user is set into an array and saved to local storage. Everytime the page is refreshed it checks local storage for old data and updates the page before taking any new input.
